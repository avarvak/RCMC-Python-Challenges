    "\n",
    "#### Pre-requisite: ClockTime - Intro to Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Poker Solitaire is a training game for Texas Hold'em version of Poker.  The objective is to get good at predicting when to bet and when to fold -- as the song says, \"Ya gotta know when to hold them, and know when to fold them\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects \"know\" something, and can \"do\" something.  So let's think about a Poker game from an Object-Oriented perspective.  The most basic objects of the game are the Cards, which \"know\" their rank and suit.  The Cards come from a Deck.  The Deck can shuffle itself and deal out Cards.  Each player has a Hand of Cards.  A Hand should be able to tell its best value--does it have a \"flush\"? a \"full house\"? a \"pair\"?--and whether it beats another Hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "So first we'll create those classes--Card, Deck, and Hand--and then we'll create a PokerSolitaire class that knows how play the game."
